== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.0.0p576

* Check routes. application#index is temporary to test react.js. Could be used for 'home' later.


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
